### Architecure

A high level Architecture of the proposed solution

![](docs/images/CC-2.png)

This demonstrates how to use Azure confidential ledger to annotate a document while preserving the confidentiality of the document contents, checking people are authorised to access the documents, and processing in main memory. We explore how Microsoftâ€™s Form recogniser can be run in a TEE, and utilise services like SQL Ledger and Azre Confidential Ledger to securely track all of the data.
